# SunPower Maxeon Integration for Home Assistant

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: API Access Requirements**

To use this integration, you **must first obtain API access credentials** from SunPower Maxeon. Please carefully follow the instructions in the official API documentation: [https://api.sunpower.maxeon.com/docs/](https://api.sunpower.maxeon.com/docs/)

- Contact Maxeon at üìß **api@maxeon.com** to request access.
- If your application is approved, you‚Äôll be asked to sign the API Terms of Use Agreement.
- Once signed, you will receive your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

> üîë **Pre-requisites**  
> You *must* have a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to use this integration. These are only provided after registration and approval by Maxeon.

### üîÑ Redirect URI

When registering your application with Customer Service, use the following **recommended** redirect URI:

```
https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth
```

Alternatively, you may use a custom redirect URI like:

```
https://your-domain:PORT/auth/external/callback
```

However, this second option requires:
- **HTTPS** enabled for your Home Assistant instance.
- Disabling the default `my.home-assistant.io` redirect by using the [default_config_disabler](https://github.com/tronikos/default_config_disabler) custom integration.
